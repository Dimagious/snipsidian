## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: How do I install Snipsy?

## üéØ Using Snippets

### Q: How do I trigger snippet expansion?
**A:** Snippets expand when you type the trigger followed by:
- **Space** (`:todo `)
- **Enter** (`:todo` + Enter)
- **Punctuation** (`:todo.`, `:todo,`, `:todo!`)

### Q: Why isn't my snippet expanding?
**A:** Check these common issues:
- **Trigger spelling** - Make sure the trigger is exactly right
- **Context** - Snippets don't expand inside code blocks or YAML frontmatter
- **Spacing** - Try adding a space after the trigger
- **Case sensitivity** - Triggers are case-sensitive

### Q: Can I use snippets in code blocks?
**A:** No, and this is intentional! Snipsy is markdown-aware and won't expand inside:
- Code blocks (`` ``` ``)
- Inline code (`` ` ``)
- YAML frontmatter

This prevents unwanted expansions in your code.

### Q: How do I position the cursor after expansion?
**A:** Use `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` in your snippet replacement:
```
Trigger: :email
Replacement: Dear CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER,

Best regards,
Your Name
```
