## üéØ What is a Snippet Package?

A **snippet package** is a collection of related snippets that can be easily installed and shared. Packages are perfect for:
- **Thematic collections** (e.g., "Academic Writing", "Programming")
- **Workflow-specific snippets** (e.g., "Meeting Notes", "Code Reviews")
- **Language-specific content** (e.g., "Spanish Phrases", "Medical Terms")
- **Tool integrations** (e.g., "Git Commands", "Docker Shortcuts")

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating Your First Package

### Step 1: Plan Your Package
1. **Choose a theme** - What problem does your package solve?
2. **Define your audience** - Who will use these snippets?
3. **List your snippets** - What triggers and replacements do you need?

### Step 2: Write the YAML
```yaml
name: "Academic Writing"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "jane-doe"
description: "Snippets for academic writing, citations, and research"
category: "academic"
tags: ["writing", "research", "citations", "academic"]
license: "MIT"

snippets:
  - trigger: ":cite"
    replace: "[@author2023]"
    description: "Insert citation placeholder"
  
  - trigger: ":ref"
    replace: "See Figure \\ref{fig:example}"
    description: "Reference to figure"
  
  - trigger: ":eq"
    replace: "\\begin{equation}\\n\\label{eq:example}\\n\\end{equation}"
    description: "LaTeX equation environment"
  
  - trigger: ":abstract"
    replace: "\\begin{abstract}\\nCURSOR_PLACEHOLDER\\n\\end{abstract}"
    description: "Abstract section"
```

### Step 3: Test Your Package
1. **Copy the YAML** to your clipboard
2. **Go to Snipsy Settings ‚Üí Community Packages**
3. **Scroll to "Submit New Package"** section
4. **Paste YAML** in the text area
5. **Click "Validate Package"** to check for errors
6. **Test your snippets** by installing them locally
7. **Refine** based on your testing

## üé® Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions
- **Triggers**: Use descriptive, memorable names
  - ‚úÖ Good: `:email`, `:phone`, `:meeting-notes`
  - ‚ùå Avoid: `:e`, `:p`, `:mn` (too cryptic)

### 2. Replacement Content
- **Be specific**: Include all necessary formatting
- **Use placeholders**: `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` for cursor positioning
- **Test thoroughly**: Make sure expansions work as expected

### 3. Package Organization
- **Logical grouping**: Group related snippets together
- **Consistent naming**: Use similar trigger patterns
- **Clear descriptions**: Help users understand each snippet

### 4. Documentation
- **README**: Include usage examples and tips
- **Descriptions**: Add descriptions to complex snippets
- **Examples**: Show how snippets work in practice

## üìù Advanced Snippet Features

### Cursor Placement
Use `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` to position the cursor after expansion:

```yaml
- trigger: ":email"
  replace: "Dear CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER,\\n\\nBest regards,\\nYour Name"
  description: "Email template with cursor in greeting"
```

### Multi-line Content
Use `\\n` for line breaks:

```yaml
- trigger: ":meeting"
  replace: "## Meeting Notes\\n\\n**Date:** CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER\\n**Attendees:** \\n**Agenda:** \\n\\n### Discussion\\n\\n### Action Items\\n- [ ] "
  description: "Meeting notes template"
```

### Special Characters
Escape special characters in YAML:

```yaml
- trigger: ":quote"
  replace: "> \"CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER\"\\n> ‚Äî Author"
  description: "Blockquote with attribution"
```
