## üîß Common Issues

### Issue: Snippet Expands in Wrong Places

**Symptoms:**
- Snippets expand inside code blocks
- Snippets expand in YAML frontmatter
- Unwanted expansions in unexpected contexts

**Causes:**
- Markdown parsing issues
- Context detection problems
- Trigger conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. **Check markdown context** - Snipsy should not expand in:
   - Code blocks (`` ``` ``)
   - Inline code (`` ` ``)
   - YAML frontmatter
2. **Use more specific triggers** - Avoid very short triggers like `:e`
3. **Check for conflicts** - Make sure no two snippets have the same trigger

### Issue: Cursor Positioning Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Cursor ends up in wrong place after expansion
- Cursor doesn't move at all
- Cursor moves to unexpected location

**Causes:**
- Missing `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` in snippet
- Incorrect placeholder usage
- Markdown parsing issues

**Solutions:**
1. **Use CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER** - Place this exactly where you want the cursor
2. **Test thoroughly** - Try your snippets in different contexts
3. **Check YAML formatting** - Make sure placeholders are properly formatted

### Issue: Package Installation Fails

**Symptoms:**
- YAML import fails
- Package doesn't appear after installation
- Error messages during installation

**Causes:**

3. **Check for conflicts** - Make sure package names don't conflict
4. **Try smaller packages** - Test with simple packages first

### Issue: Snippet Picker Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Snippet picker doesn't open
- Search doesn't work
- No snippets appear in picker

**Causes:**
- Command not registered
- Search index issues
- UI rendering problems

**Solutions:**
1. **Check command registration** - Go to Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys and search for "Snipsy"
2. **Restart Obsidian** - Clear any UI state issues
3. **Check snippet count** - Make sure you have snippets installed
4. **Try different search terms** - Test with simple searches
